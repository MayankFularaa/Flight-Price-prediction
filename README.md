# Flight-Price-prediction
This project analyzes flight prices and prepares a dataset for machine learning through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering (FE). The goal was to predict flight prices based on features like Airline, Date of Journey, Source, Destination, Route, Duration, and Timing.

Data Transformation:

EDA: Identified trends and outliers in price, duration, and other features.

Feature Engineering:

Extracted Day, Month, and Weekday from Date of Journey.

Converted Duration into numerical hours.

Encoded categorical features (e.g., Airline, Stops) using One-Hot and Label Encoding.

Missing Values: Imputed missing data using median/mode.

Scaling: Standardized numerical features like Price and Duration.
